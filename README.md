The purpose of this app is to gather info about official holidays for currencies and dates defined by user. It can be used for better understanding if you can plan some currency operations for certain dates, for example. 
Deployment available at https://holidays-helper.herokuapp.com/

App is written on Javascript with React. There is a basic Node.js server to run everything on host.  

It uses Calendarific API with a basic fetch requests to get national holidays for the specified dates and counties.
Few custom narrowings added after small domain research for specific currencies, because some currencies used in many countries and there are some specific lists of holidays applied to them. 

There is no absolute guarantee about recieved result, so it's better to double-check them in other source. But many test shown that the app is quite aqqurate.

This Project was made with educational purposes and to have a fun with programming. 

Let the Holidays Spirit be with you! :)
